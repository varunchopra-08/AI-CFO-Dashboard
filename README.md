### Example AI Recommendation

```
🔴 CRITICAL - Revenue Recovery
Issue: 18.5% revenue decline with seasonal patterns detected

AI Analysis: The decline correlates with market saturation in Q2. 
Your customer acquisition cost increased 40% while conversion rates 
dropped 25%, indicating positioning issues.

Recommended Actions:
• Week 1: Conduct win-loss interviews with last 20 deals
• Week 2-3: Launch competitor positioning analysis
• Month 2: Pilot new value proposition with segment A
• Month 3: Implement pricing optimization based on findings
• Ongoing: Daily revenue dashboard monitoring with alerts

Expected Impact: 12-15% recovery within 90 days if executed, 
potential 20%+ upside with successful repositioning
```

### 💬 AI Q&A Feature (New!)

Ask natural language questions about your financial data and get instant, data-driven answers.

**Example Questions:**
```
Q: What is our cash runway and when will we run out of money?
A: Based on your current burn rate of $45,230/month and starting cash 
   of $300,000, you have approximately 6.6 months of runway remaining. 
   At current projections, cash will be depleted by June 2025. 
   
   RECOMMENDATION: Begin fundraising immediately, as the process typically 
   takes 4-6 months. Cut non-essential expenses by 20% to extend runway 
   to 8 months.

Q: Which expense categories should we prioritize cutting?
A: Analysis shows:
   1. Marketing: $18,450/month (40% of expenses) - highest category
   2. Software/Tools: $6,200/month (14%) - 15% growth month-over-month
   3. Office/Overhead: $4,100/month (9%) - flat trend
   
   PRIORITY CUTS:
   - Marketing: Reduce CAC by optimizing channel mix (save $5-7K/month)
   - Software: Audit unused subscriptions (potential $1-2K/month savings)
   - Hold office expenses flat (already optimized)
   
   Total potential savings: $6-9K/month = 2 additional months runway
```

**Features:**
- 🔍 Contextual understanding of your complete financial situation
- 📊 Specific numbers, percentages, and trends from your data
- 💡 Actionable recommendations with expected impact
- 📝 Conversation history with export capability
- ⚡ AI-generated suggested questions based on your data
